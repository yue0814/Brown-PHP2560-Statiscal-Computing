# Practicing Julia Basics


## Arrays and Indexing


In lab today you will get a chance to explore arrays in Julia.

### Question 1

In Julia run the following command:
```
srand(1234)
x1 = rand(10000)
```

1. What is the length of `x1`?
```
#julia>length(x1)
```
```
#10000
```

2. What is the 55th element of `x1`?
```
#julia>x1[55]
```
```
#0.2924615242315285
```

3. What is the final element of `x1`?
```
#julia>x1[end]
```
```
#0.0055542239982036
```

4. What is the smallest value of `x1`?
```
#julia>minimum(x1)
```
```
#1.0125579466002677e-6
```

5. How many values are greater than 0.1 but less than 0.57?
```
#julia>sum(0.1.<x1.<0.57)
```
```
#4784
```

6. What is the 4000th smallest value of `x1`?
```
#julia> sort(x1)[4000]
```
```
#0.4065088736851672
```

### Question 2

In Julia run the following command:
```
srand(1234)
x2 = rand(0:1,10000)
```

1. How many times does 1 appear in `x2`?
```
#julia> sum(x2.==1)
```
```
#4969
```

2. What is the position in the array of the first occurrence of 1?
```
#julia> findfirst(x2,1)
```
```
#2
```

3. What is the position in the array of the last occurrence of 1?
```
#julia> findlast(x2,1)
```
```
#9999
```

4. What position in the vector is the 2406th occurrence of 1?
```
#julia> find(x2.==1)[2406]
```
```
#4837
```

### Question 3 

In Julia run the following command:
```
srand(1234)
x3= randstring(10000)
```

1. Create an 1 column array with only one letter in each position name this `x3`. 
```
#julia> split(x3,"")
```
```
#10000-element Array{SubString{ASCIIString},1}:
# "m"
# "b"
# â‹®
# "V"
# "O"
```

2. How many times does "A" appear in `x3`?
```
#julia> length(matchall(r"A", x3))
```
```
#163
```

3. How many pairs of letters are there in `x3` (AA, BB)?
```
#julia> length(matchall(r"([A-z0-9])\1", x3))+length(matchall(r"([A-z0-9])\1\1", x3))
#those forms like AAA should be count into 2 pairs of AA, so we should add 1 each
```
```
#178
```

4. What letter appears the least? The most?
```
#upper = collect(Char(i) for i in 65:90)
#lower = collect(Char(i) for i in 97:122)
#len_upp = [1]
#len_low = [1]
#for i in 1:26
#       l1 = find(x3) do l
#       l == upper[i]
#       end
#       push!(len_upp, length(l1))
#       end
#for i in 1:26
#       l2 = find(x3) do l
#       l == lower[i]
#       end
#       push!(len_low, length(l2))
#       end
#shift!(len_upp)
#shift!(len_low)
```
```
#if findmax(len_upp)[1] > findmax(len_low)[1]
#print(upper[findmax(len_upp)[2]], " appears the most")
#else
#print(lower[findmax(len_low)[2]], " appears the most")
#end
```
```
w appears the most
```
```
#if findmin(len_upp)[1] < findmin(len_low)[1]
#print(upper[findmin(len_upp)[2]], " appears the least")
#else
#print(lower[findmin(len_low)[2]], " appears the least")
#end
```
```
U appears the least
```
